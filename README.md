# tic-tac-toe

Project Outline:

This is a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The primary objective of this project was to create a Tic Tac Toe game whilst hiding away as many variables as I could inside factory functions. By doing this I could practice encapsulation and get comfortable with understanding scope.

Challenges:

This was a whole new way of thinking and it was challenging because I had to create a working/playable version of the game in the console first without thinking about the HTML and CSS layout. This meant when it came to creating the UI aspect of the page I had to relearn and rethink about how I'd made my factorial functions as I'd forgotten the 'levers' and functionality I'd built into them. I also had to consider how functions would pass functions and values between one another.

There was an issue where the 'X's and 'O's inside the grid would have a large block of whitespace above the font I originally used. This whitespace would extend up into the grid boxes above, which meant clicking the grid square above any grid square with a marker in it would result in the game thinking the empty square was already filled - Much less than ideal! It took a while for me to work this out as I kept looking over my code, alas it was the font choice and sizing that was the culprit.

Conclusion:

I'm happy with how this turned out and how it tested me along the way. I seem to have quite a lot of code (Over 250 lines!), though I think this is a side effect of me trying to get my head around this new way of thinking. I'd like to find a way to do the same project with less lines of code, though I'm sure I could refactor this code further. Overall an awesome learning experience!

Completed 29/9/24.
